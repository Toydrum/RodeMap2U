/**
 * «El corazón del árbol» (0.0.112) — the PURE heart brain, sister of
 * harvest.ts. The owner's model: the node born with the tree's name is the
 * CENTER of the goal, not a task — its first little branches grow from it,
 * and when they all bloom, the tree blooms whole.
 *
 * THE RULE: the heart is the tree's FIRST visible root (derived — zero
 * schema; roots are never reorderable, so first-by-order is stable; a
 * persisted Tree.heartId stays documented as the v13 upgrade if that ever
 * changes). A heart WITH children is a CONTAINER: never suggested, never
 * pickable as a task, slim sheet, blooms only through the offered door. A
 * BARE heart is the goal itself: it keeps entering through the compass
 * doors that already special-case it (the first-pasito question, the
 * regadera «big» partition). Legacy extra roots (index > 0 — «+ Plantar
 * aquí» used to mint new trunks) stay ordinary tasks forever.
