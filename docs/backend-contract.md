# RoadMap2U — Backend Contract (Cognito + API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB)

**Normative types: [`src/app/core/api/contracts.ts`](../src/app/core/api/contracts.ts).** This document explains the semantics; the TypeScript file is the single source of shapes, paths, error codes and limits. Three implementations type against it: the on-device mock (`core/api/mock-api.ts` — the *executable spec*), the client transport (`core/api/http-api.ts`), and the Lambda router in [`Toydrum/roadmap2u-backend`](https://github.com/Toydrum/roadmap2u-backend), which consumes a parity-checked vendored copy. If a shape needs to change, change `contracts.ts` first and let the compiler surface every consequence.

Owner decisions baked in (2026-07-06): login becomes **mandatory at AWS go-live**; guardians can **edit/plant** in a linked minor's forest (co-gardening); **linking existing accounts** ships in v1; infrastructure-as-code lives in the separate backend repository.

---

## 1. Principles

1. **Local-first storage.** The device's IndexedDB is the working copy. The cloud is a per-user record store + identity + relationships. Sync is per-record LWW by `rev` — the exact law `RecordsRepo.applyExternal` already applies locally.
2. **The profile table is the authorization truth.** Lambdas authorize per request from DynamoDB link records — never from token claims alone. The `custom:accountType` claim is defense-in-depth.
3. **No discovery.** No user search, no public profiles, no username-availability endpoint (only `USERNAME_TAKEN` on create). Codes are the only introduction. Denied forest reads return `NOT_FOUND`, never `FORBIDDEN` — no existence oracle.
4. **Privacy boundaries are server-side.** Stripping (`note`/`trigger`/`targetDate`) happens in the Lambda, not the client. Check-ins, sessions and settings are NEVER served to another user, ever.
5. **No-shame mechanics.** Friend declines are silent; requests expire quietly (14 days); nothing notifies rejection.
6. **The mock is the spec.** Every rule here is enforced by `mock-api.ts` against the on-device `roadmap2u-mockcloud` DB with deterministic fixtures (`mock-seed.ts`). If mock and doc disagree, fix one — before go-live they must agree.

## 2. Identity — Cognito user pool

Checklist (mirrored in `cognito-auth.provider.ts`; the backend stack implements it):

- Sign-in by **username** (3–20 `[a-z0-9_]`, unique). Email is an **optional, verifiable attribute** — adults have one, guardian-created minors have none (the guardian IS the recovery channel).
- App client **without secret**; `ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH` (+ refresh). No Hosted UI and no OAuth flows; the app uses its custom account UI and needs no redirect callback.
- Verification & recovery by **CODE**, never emailed links.
- Password policy = `PASSWORD_POLICY` in `auth-types.ts` (min 8, upper+lower+digit). Align the pool to the const.
- Custom attribute `custom:accountType: 'adult' | 'minor'`, mutable, **written by the backend only** (PostConfirmation trigger for self-signups → `adult`; `AdminCreateUser` for minors → `minor`).
- Self-signup **enabled** (creates adults; PostConfirmation Lambda writes the DynamoDB profile). Minors are born ONLY via `POST /family/children` → `AdminCreateUser` (`MessageAction: SUPPRESS`, temp password) → the child's first sign-in lands in `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`.
- Guardian password reset for `created` minors = `AdminSetUserPassword` (temporary), returned once as `tempPassword`.

## 3. Accounts, family, friends

```
AccountType 'adult' | 'minor'      ('teen' is NOT a type)
UserProfile { userId, username, displayName, accountType, socialEnabled, createdAt }
GuardianLink { linkId, guardianId, minorId, kind: 'created'|'invited', createdAt }
Friendship { friendshipId, userA, userB, createdAt }
```

- **Parent/admin** = adult with ≥1 GuardianLink as guardian. **Child** = minor + `socialEnabled: false` (no friend surfaces at all). **Teen** = minor + `socialEnabled: true` (friends + visits; still guardian-administered). Adults always `socialEnabled: true`.
- **Link kinds.** `created` (guardian created this minor): full identity admin — rename, reset password, social toggle, export-first delete. `invited` (an existing account accepted a family invite): guardian gets forest view+**edit** and friend oversight, but NO identity admin (the account owns itself; either side can unlink).
- Caps (`LIMITS`): ≤2 guardians per minor · ≤8 children per guardian · ≤50 friends · sync push ≤100 records · 5 bad code redemptions/hour.
- **LAST_GUARDIAN rule:** the last active link on a `created` minor cannot be removed (an orphaned minor could never recover a password). The exit is export-first deletion.
- **Invites** (`POST /family/invites`): `{kind:'coGuardian', minorId}` → another ADULT redeems and co-guards that minor; only a guardian whose `created` link is still active may issue or complete this delegation, so an `invited` guardian cannot escalate another adult. `{kind:'linkExisting'}` → any existing account redeems and becomes the issuer's `invited` minor-side link. Codes: 8 chars, 72 h, single-use. Consent = redemption.
- **Friend codes** (`GET /friends/code`): 8 chars (Crockford base32, no vowels/lookalikes), 7-day expiry, multi-use until expiry/rotation; every redemption still requires an explicit accept. `POST /friends/code/rotate` invalidates immediately. Requests expire after 14 days; declines are silent.
- **Guardian oversight:** guardians list/remove a minor's friendships and cancel their outgoing requests — but cannot INITIATE requests for the minor. The minor sees exactly what the guardian sees (no covert controls). Toggling `socialEnabled` off hides friend surfaces and blocks visits both ways but **destroys nothing**.

## 4. Permissions matrix (Lambda authz AND client gating)

| Actor → target | View forest | Node notes/dates | Feelings/check-ins/sessions | Edit/plant | Administer identity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| self → own | yes | yes | yes | yes | own |
| guardian → linked minor (both kinds) | yes — **full** nodes | yes (they can edit them) | **never** | **yes** (co-gardening) | `created`: yes · `invited`: no |
| minor → their guardian | yes — stripped | no | never | no | no |
| friend ↔ friend (both social-enabled) | yes — stripped | no | never | no | no |
| child (social off) → non-family | nothing | — | — | — | — |
| stranger → anyone | **404** | — | — | — | — |

*Stripped* = `note → ''`, `trigger → null`, `targetDate → null`, archived + tombstoned excluded. Visits render a neutral sky (weather derives from private feelings). Family visibility is **mutual** and disclosed to the child in-UI.

## 5. API surface

REST under `${apiBaseUrl}/v1`, JSON, `Authorization: Bearer <Cognito idToken>` (HTTP API JWT authorizer). Paths/verbs in `API_PATHS` + `http-api.ts`. Sign-in/up/challenges are NOT here — they ride the Cognito SDK through the `AuthProvider` seam.

| Group | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| me | `GET /me` (profile + family links — one call paints the account section) · `PATCH /me` (displayName) |
| family | `POST /family/children` → `{child, tempPassword}` (shown once) · `POST /family/children/:id/reset-password` · `PATCH /family/children/:id` (displayName, socialEnabled) · `GET /family/children/:id/export` (ExportEnvelope) · `DELETE /family/children/:id` (export-first client flow) · `DELETE /family/links/:linkId` · `POST /family/invites` · `POST /family/invites/accept` · `DELETE /family/invites/:code` · `GET /family/children/:id/friends` · `DELETE /family/children/:id/friends/:fid` · `DELETE /family/children/:id/requests/:rid` |
| friends | `GET /friends` (friends + incoming + outgoing) · `GET /friends/code` · `POST /friends/code/rotate` · `POST /friends/requests {code}` · `POST /friends/requests/:id/accept` · `POST /friends/requests/:id/decline` · `DELETE /friends/requests/:id` · `DELETE /friends/:friendshipId` |
| forests | `GET /users/:id/forest` → `ForestSnapshot { owner, detail: 'full'\|'stripped', trees, nodes, fetchedAt }` — detail chosen by relationship per §4 |
| sync | `GET /sync/changes?cursor=` · `POST /sync/push` · `POST /users/:id/sync/push` (guardian write-through: records land in the minor's store; their devices pull them) |

**Errors:** envelope `{ error: { code, message } }`; `code ∈ ApiErrorCode` (SCREAMING codes on the wire; lowercase `offline|server|unknown` are client-minted). `message` is for developers — the client maps codes to i18n copy.

**Sync semantics:**
- Push: per record, accept iff `lwwBeats(incoming, stored)` — the ONE ordering in `contracts.ts`: higher `rev` wins, equal revs fall to `updatedAt`, exact ties keep the STORED copy (DynamoDB conditional write); else reject `{id, reason:'STALE_REV'}` AND return the stored winner in `serverRecords`. Clients accept server records on exact ties (`applyExternal`), so every replica converges on one copy.
- Tombstones (`deletedAt` set) travel as ordinary records; the server never physically deletes records (account deletion purges the whole partition).
- Change feed ordered by **server receive time** (`syncedAt`), exposed as an opaque `cursor`; page ≤ 200, `more` flag. Client clocks are never trusted for ordering.
- The server validates only `SyncBase` shape + the store enum and stores records opaquely → additive schema evolution (the `trigger`/`flow` precedent) needs zero backend change. A push with `schemaVersion` NEWER than the server understands → `SYNC_TOO_OLD` (client asks user to update the app... the server, actually — the error names the direction for the client copy).
- Settings are device preferences (no `rev`) — **not synced**.

## 6. DynamoDB — single table `roadmap`

On-demand billing, TTL enabled, 2 GSIs, item-per-record (a tree-document would fight the 400 KB item limit and break per-record LWW).

| Entity | PK | SK | GSI1 PK / SK | GSI2 PK / SK | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Profile | `USER#<id>` | `PROFILE` | — | — | username, displayName, accountType, socialEnabled, friendCode ptr |
| Username guard | `UNIQ#USERNAME#<lower>` | `UNIQ` | — | — | TransactWrite + `attribute_not_exists` |
| GuardianLink | `USER#<minorId>` | `GUARDIAN#<guardianId>` | `USER#<guardianId>` / `MINOR#<minorId>` | — | one item, queryable both directions |
| Friendship ×2 | `USER#<a>` | `FRIEND#<b>` | — | — | two mirrored items in one transaction (shared friendshipId) |
| FriendRequest | `USER#<toId>` | `FREQ#<reqId>` | `USER#<fromId>` / `FREQ#<reqId>` | — | incoming = base query, outgoing = GSI1; TTL 14 d |
| FriendCode | `CODE#F#<code>` | `CODE` | — | — | userId; TTL 7 d |
| GuardianInvite | `CODE#G#<code>` | `CODE` | — | — | issuerId, kind, minorId?; TTL 72 h |
| Record | `USER#<owner>` | `REC#<store>#<id>` | — | `USER#<owner>` / `CHG#<syncedAt>#<id>` | full client record + server `syncedAt`; store ∈ trees\|nodes\|checkins\|sessions |

Access patterns: me = GetItem + two link queries · my minors = GSI1 · forest visit = two Queries (`begins_with REC#trees#` / `REC#nodes#`) + Lambda filter/strip · change feed = GSI2 Query after cursor · push = conditional PutItem per record (`attribute_not_exists(pk) OR rev < :rev OR (rev = :rev AND updatedAt < :updatedAt)` — `lwwBeats` as a condition; the Record item mirrors `updatedAt` top-level for it) · username uniqueness & friendship mirroring = TransactWriteItems. Null SyncBase fields stored as absent attributes.

## 7. Lambda authz rules (per group)

- **Every route:** JWT authorizer already verified the token; resolve `callerId = claims.sub`; load caller profile (404-shaped `UNAUTHENTICATED` if missing — deleted account with live token).
- **/family/children/:id/***: require an ACTIVE GuardianLink (caller = guardian, :id = minor). Identity-admin routes (`reset-password`, `PATCH socialEnabled`, `DELETE child`) additionally require `kind === 'created'`. `DELETE /family/links/:linkId`: caller must be that link's guardian; refuse `LAST_GUARDIAN` when it is a `created` minor's last link.
- **/friends/***: require caller `socialEnabled` (adults always). Redemption rate-limited (5 BAD attempts/hour → `RATE_LIMITED`; read-first, bump only on invalid/expired codes — successes never count). A second pending request to the same person is `CONFLICT`, race-proof via a per-direction deterministic requestId + conditional put. `maxFriends` is enforced at request time AND at accept (either side may have filled up while the request sat). Accept requires being the request's `toId`; cancel its `fromId`.
- **GET /users/:id/forest**: relationship lookup → `full` (guardian→minor), `stripped` (minor→guardian, friend↔friend), else `NOT_FOUND`. Friend visits additionally require `socialEnabled` on BOTH sides.
- **POST /users/:id/sync/push**: require GuardianLink guardian→:id (either kind). Same LWW law as own-push; records land in the minor's partition.

## 8. Mock parity

`mock-api.ts` + `mock-auth.provider.ts` enforce everything above on-device: same codes, same caps, same LWW, same strip rules. Deterministic by doctrine (rule 4): confirmation code `123456`, fixed demo passwords, `hash()`-derived latencies (250–400 ms). Demo family (`mock-seed.ts`): **rocio** (adult guardian, `Bosque123`) · **nico** (created-minor, social off, temp `Semilla1!` → NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED) · **val** (minor, social on, friends with Ámbar) · **ambar** (adult, the lush visitable forest, `Bosque123`). "Restablecer la nube de prueba" (Settings, mock mode only) wipes `roadmap2u-mockcloud`; it reseeds on next use. Determinism is a MOCK property — the real backend uses crypto RNG for codes/passwords.

## 9. Rollout

| Phase | Ships | Backend needed |
|---|---|---|
| «cuentas» (this one) | auth seams + /account ritual + contracts + this doc | none (mock) |
| «familia» | /me UI, create-child, admin ops, both invite kinds | none (mock) |
| «conectar mi bosque» | sync engine (watermark push over `onLocalWrite`, cursor pull into `applyExternal`), connect action | none (mock) |
| «amigos y visitas» | friends UI, visit routes (route-scoped read-only repos), guardian co-gardening | none (mock) |
| **AWS go-live** | Deploy `Toydrum/roadmap2u-backend` → verify its SSM handoff → enable the frontend AWS gate → deploy `main` to `dev` and promote the exact successful SHA through `test` to `prod` → **flip `requireAuth: true`** only when local-forest adoption is ready | all of it |

The separate backend repository **implements this contract** with Cognito per §2, the table in §6, an HTTP API + JWT authorizer, and the router/handlers for §5/§7. Its vendored contract is guarded by byte parity and by the normalized deployment digest described in [`backend-extraction.md`](./backend-extraction.md). Each deployed stage publishes frontend configuration to SSM; the frontend generates `APP_CONFIG` during CI/CD and never accepts hand-copied stack outputs.

**The execution runbook lives in [`aws-connect.md`](./aws-connect.md)** — exact stage URLs, SSM handoff, GitHub variables, CORS boundaries, verification gates, promotion, cutover, and rollback. This document is the WHAT; that one is the HOW.
